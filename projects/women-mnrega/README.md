<p><small>Project based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>. #cookiecutterdatascience</small></p>

<p><small>The project of Women Mnrega is regarding consolidating the data for different years based on state->district->block into a final merged csv</small></p>

<p><small>Used python libraries as well as fucntions 
<ul>
  <li>setting the path </li>
  <li>Getting the sub folder names</li>
  <li>Appending the data frames using a for loop to iterate through subfolders and in them files</li>
  <li>converting our appended dataframes to a single dataframe and finally a csv</li>
</ul>
</small></p>

<p><small>File name Task2.py stored in .\src\data folder</small></p>
